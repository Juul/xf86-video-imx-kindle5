This is the source code for the xf86 imx video driver as published by Amazon in their 5.4.3.2 source code release:

https://kindle.s3.amazonaws.com/Kindle_src_5.4.3.2_2317380003.tar.gz

The imx video driver was tagged with the date 2011-04-11.

A different version is floating around online at:

https://gitorious.org/xf86-video-imx/xf86-video-imx/

but that version hasn't been updated since 2010-08-16.

Nothing has been modified since the Amazon release except for the addition of this README file.
